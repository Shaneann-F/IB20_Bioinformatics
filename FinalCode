#This shell script is to look for two genes in any target species
#Arguments within the shell script are as follows $1=hsp70*.fasta reference genes, $2=mcr*.fasta reference genes, $3=proteome*.fasta target genes
#The output containing target species with both reference genes will be presented in a table.

#We combine all files for gene1 into one fasta file
#Make sure that the directory for your tools hmmr and muscle correspond to your pathway. Ours are located two directories above. 
#We then align the files with muscle
#We then build a regular expression using the tool hmmbuild

cat $gene >> gene1.fa

#We combine all files for gene2 into one fasta file. 
#Make sure that the directory for your tools hmmr and muscle correspond to your pathway. Ours are located two directories above.
#We then align the files with muscle
#We then build a regular expression using the tool hmmbuild

#First, this loop is for hmm search to generate a table for gene1 and gene2 using the target sequences
#Then we search for the proteomes which contain hsp and mcr genes of interest

#We now append the two match[1,2].txt files into a new file with three columns: Target Species, Match 1, Match 2 respectively


#We generate the table with Target species with a for loop. This should give the respective target sequence.

#We combine all columns into one file.
paste proteomename.txt matches1.txt matches2.txt > matchescombined.txt
